# 🎓 AI-Powered On-Prem Learning Platform

## 🚀 Overview

The school aims to deploy an **on-premises AI server** to enhance the learning experience for its **300 active students** located in **Nagasaki**. This AI-driven educational service will operate **within the school's infrastructure**, ensuring a **personalized and secure learning environment**.

## 🎯 Assumptions

- The **foundational AI model** will be trained using the **school's curriculum**, incorporating the **specific linguistic requirements** of all languages taught.
- AI capabilities will align with **educational objectives**, supporting structured learning methodologies.

## ⚠️ Risks

- Students may attempt to **misuse the AI model** for **non-educational purposes**, which could impact server performance and **resource allocation**.
- Potential **biases in AI responses** if not properly trained and evaluated.

## ⛓️ Constraints

- **Hardware resources** (CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage) will be affected based on **usage demand**.
- **AI model performance** may degrade with **excessive concurrent requests**.
- The **system must be scalable** to accommodate potential student growth.

## 📊 Data Strategy

- **Avoid copyright issues** by using licensed or open-source educational content.
- Implement **robust guardrails** to prevent the generation of inappropriate or misleading content.
- Regularly update datasets to maintain **accuracy and relevance**.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Design

Since the school requires an **on-premises** AI solution, the infrastructure must ensure:

- **High-speed internet bandwidth** to support real-time interactions.
- **Resilient architecture** with failover mechanisms for **high availability**.
- **Regular system monitoring and maintenance** to prevent disruptions.
- **Power backup solutions** to ensure continuous operation during outages.
