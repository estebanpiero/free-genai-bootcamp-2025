You said:

    la casa e spanventoso

ChatGPT said:

    Your sentence: "La casa e spanventoso"

    ❌ Issues:
    "e" → Should be written with an accent to form the correct verb (è).
    "spanventoso" → This word is misspelled; the correct spelling is "spaventoso".
    Adjective Agreement → "Casa" is feminine, so "spaventoso" needs to match its gender.
    ✅ Correct Sentence:
